## CSocket 

**CSocket** is a **powerful, header-only C socket library** that simplifies creating and managing **TCP**, **UDP**, and **RAW sockets** for **IPv4** and **IPv6**. It supports **SSL/TLS connections**, **threaded TCP servers**, and provides utilities for **host resolution** and advanced socket options.

Being **header-only**, it requires no compilation of separate source files—just include `CSocket.h` in your project.
